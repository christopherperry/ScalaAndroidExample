ScalaAndroidExample
===================

An example project for using Scala on Android with the standard Android Gradle Plugin, and the
[Gradle Android Scala Plugin](https://github.com/saturday06/gradle-android-scala-plugin).

This example works with Android Studio (tested v0.8.9), however the shortcut for creating
new Scala files in the scala source directory doesn't seem to be working.
